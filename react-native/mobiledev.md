# Mobile Development
- People like their smart phones
- People want to do many common software tasks using their phone
- Two main solutions
    - Mobile friendly website
        - Advantages
            - Complete access to html/CSS/JS
            - Access to any browser APIS
                - Fetch
                - LocalStorage
        - Disadvantages
            - Targeting specific IOS or Android not particuaarly possible
            - Lose some access to native phone APIS
                - ability to integrate into the camera, gryoscope, gps......
            - Cannot be used offline
    - Create a **native** app for the phone
        - Advantages
            - Performance is better
            - UI might be a better experience because it intrsically uses UI elements used by the phone
            - Ability to use the home button
            - Can be used offline
        - Disadvantages 
            - Development more difficult
            - Android and IOS apps
                - Android apps : Written in Kotlin
                - IOS apps: written in Swift
            - Lose access to web APIs
- A large problem is writing a different app for 2 different types of smart phones
- Kotlin and Swift are not languages which have tons of developers
## Solution
- Have a platform that you can write the App once 
    - The platoform will generate IOS and Android versions
    - Flutter 
        - Desktop
        - Smart Phones
        - Web
    - The main problem with Flutter
        - **Developers do not know Flutter**
        - It is a new platform 
        - It is written in Dart which is not popular
- Web Developers are going to be the most common developers in today's environment
    - Companies want to leverage these developers and their skills
    - Web Developers are going to have certain skills
        - HTML/CSS/JS
        - **React** 
- ***React Native***
    - A way for React developers to leverage their skills at creating a mobile applicaiton
    - React Native is cross platform and allows for writing an application in JS that works for Android and IOS
    - Many web features that you are looking for do not exist
        - LocalStorage
        - fetch does not exist
        - DOM related commands getElementById()
        - Most CSS
        - **Anything that is proprietary to a web browser**
    - Be careful when you write your code to *NOT* include anything that would use a feature on web browser
- The motto of React Native
    - *Learn Once Write Anywhere*
    - You cannot port React web applications to a mobile device
