# JWT
- JSON Web Tokens
- The core problem is HOW do we identify ourselves on the internet.
- Old school session management approach
    1. A person would login in
        - Prove who they are by sending a username and password
    2. The backend server will create a session (an object in memory) with information about that user
        - role
        - when they logged in
        - permissions etc...
    3. The server will send back a cookie that has an property that references the id of that session
    4. This id is stored the browser and used to make requests to the backend
- JWT approach
    1. A person would login in
        - Prove who they are by sending a username and password
    2. return a **JWT token** that says with information about that user
        - role
        - when the toke expires
        - persmission 
        - etc...
        - These are the **claims** of the token
    3. The token is stored somewhere in the browser,
        - Every time a user makes an http request they pass the token in a header
    4. The backend **validates** the token
        - Makes sure that it has NOT been tampered with

- **How can you write a document such that once created it would be impossible to edit without the issuer noticing**
    - You need to use the content of the message/docuement to generate a value that can be used to verify the content
    - The **signature** is this computed value.
- The security of a JWT is giving a person a document that cannot be edited
    - There is not other *security* in a JWT
    - JWTs can be stolen (huge problem of JWTs)
- Validating JWTs is like a really stupid bouncer at a bar
    - he checks to see if the ID presented is real and claims if you are 21 or over
    - There is no way to take that ID and see if it matches the person with that ID
    
## Encoded vs Encrypted
- Encoded (utility)
    - Turn the information into a different format
    - It can easily be turned back into the original
    - The main purpose is to make transporation of the information easier
- Encrypted (security)
    - Turn information into a format that is unreadable
    - Requires that a person have a specific key/password to decrypt the information to read it


## JWT anatomy
- It is just a JSON that has been encoded into base64
    - Done to support all special characters
- **Header**
    - JSON of meta information about the JWT
    - Algorithm used to encode it
    - The fact that it is a JWT
- **Payload**
    - JSON of the main infromation in the JWT
    - The properties are the claims of the token
- **Signature**
    - A hashed value that the issuer can check to see if you edited the payload of the JWT
