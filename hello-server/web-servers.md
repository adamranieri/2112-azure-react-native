# Web Servers and HTTP
- The best program in the world means nothing unless people have some way to communicate with it.
    - Desktop Application which uses a Graphical User Interace
    - A console applications that just prints to the terminal and people type into it
    - ***Web Servers*** are programs/appplications that can take in inupts via HTTP.

## HTTP
- HTTP **Hyper Text Transfer Protocol**
- It is a request response based protocol.
    - A user/client makes an **HTTP Request** 
    - The server/web-server responds with an **HTTP Response**
    - Every Request is guaranteed to generate a response
- Web Servers and HTTP are supposed to be Language Agnostic
    - The client does NOT need to know what programming language the server is written
