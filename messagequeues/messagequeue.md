# Messaging in Microservices
- Your services need to talk to each other
    - Services make HTTP requests to each other
        - Fastest way to communicate
        - Need to know the IP address of the service
        - Service needs to be up and running
- **Messaging Queues**
    - Simple way for applications to talk to each other
    - **TTL**
        - Time to live
        - How long a message can be in the queue before being deleted
    - Advantages
        - Services do not have to communicate directly with each other
            - Helps to make microservices indepenedent and less coupled with each other
        - Queues are VERY scalable
            - Easy to scale produces and consumers
        - Queues are VERY reliable
            - A consumer goes down more messages will pile in the Queue with no messages being lost
            - Unprocessable messgaes often go to a **dead letter queue** to viewed by developers
        - Often very cheap
    - Disadvantages
        - ONE way data flow
            - If you need infromation in a response then a queue is not for youe
        - *Slow*
            - Could takes seconds-hours for it to be processed from the queue
            - Not good for anything that needs to be handled immmediately
- **Service Bus**
