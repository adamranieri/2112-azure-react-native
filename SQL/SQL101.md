# SQL
- **Structured Query Languague**
    - Programming language
        - It does have functions/variables/logic
        - Not designed to be friendly to program in.
    - Scripting Language
        - Tells a machine what to do
            - SQL is used to tell the database to create a table or insert data
- **DSL**
    - Domain Specific Language
    - Language designed to do one thing and one thing only
        - SQL
            - For managing and creating databases
        - CSS
            - For styling on a web page
- **RDBMS**
    - Relational Database Management System
        - Postgres
        - MySQL
        - MariaDB
        - Oracle (lame)
        - Microsoft SQL Server
- **Database**
    - Something that stores **persistent** information
        - Does the data exist in some physcial medium?
        - Could it survive the power being turned off.
            - Hardrive
            - Manetic Tape
            - Cuneiform Tablets
- **Relational Database**
    - Stores data as Tables.
    - Those Tables *reference* one another
- **Table**
    - Columns/attributes
        - Vertical
        - The name of the data field
    - Rows/records
        - Horizontal
        - A single enity of data
- **Constraint**
    - A property we can add to a column that restricts what data can be stored in that column
        - **Primary Key**
            - Every table should have 1 column that serves as a primary key
                - You can only have 1 primary key per table
                - Can be a composite key (more advanced)
            - Unique identifier for that record
            - It should never change
            - It is a combination of *not null* + *unique*
        - check
        - not null
        - unqiue
        - default
        - **Foriegn Key**
        - *serial*
            - Not really a constraint
            - Shorthand syntax for making a column
                - auto increment the value
- **Transactions**
    - The base unit of database editing
    - Any updates to a database are done in a *transaction*
    - ACID properites of transaction
        - **Atomic** *all or nothing*
            - Either every statement has to work for it to be commited
                - 3/3 => all statements will be committed
            - If a single statement does not work *nothing* is commited
                - 2/3 => no records being commited
        - **Consistent**
            - Database moves only via transactions from one consistent state to another
            - There is no midway commit point in a transaction where half the statements are commited and the other half need to be processed
        - **Isolated**
            - In reality multiple transaction started by different clients/users could be working in parallel on your database.
            - The RDBMS will have isolation levels when processing transactions to prevent inconsistent phenomena
            - In short, if you have mulitple transactions running at once, you can have inconsistencies in reading the database
        - **Durable**
            - Any failures in a transactions are handled gracefully.
            - No corrupted data or data loss.
