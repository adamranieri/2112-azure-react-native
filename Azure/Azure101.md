# Azure

- What is cloud computing?
    - Any IT infrastructure requires hardware and configuration
        - Computers to run your web servers
        - Routers for directing traffic
        - Databases for stroing information
    - It is difficult and expensive to do these things yourself
        - IT infrastructure is VERY hard unless you are a MASSIVE company
    - Cloud computing makes all the IT infrastructure available through the internet    
        - You can create any computers, databases, networking though an online portal
        - Much easier, faster, and cheaper than you trying to do it manually
        - Cloud applications can scale
            - Commission more computers when needed
            - Decomssion when not in use
