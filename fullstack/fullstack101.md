# Building a full stack application
1. Create my entities
    - General Data model
    - (You guys are using a NoSQL database which really supports flexible data models)
2. Create my repos
    - one for the backend
    - one for the front-end
3. Design my interaces and write tests
4. Work on features.
    - Create vertical slices of functionality
    - Try to avoid working on a full stack applicaiton one layer at a time
    - do
        - Get all books working
        - Login employee
        - Create book
    - don't
        - create all routes at once
        - create every DAO at the same exact time and implement all at once
    **Be Agile** in your approach and recognize that you will likely have to change data models or update a method signature
