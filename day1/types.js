// JS as 7 primitves
// unlike other languages (looking at you Java), 
// primitive is a semantic term, some of the primitives ARE objects

const adam = "Adam"; // string
const age = 19; // number, there is no float, or int, or double in JS
const isTrainer = true; // boolean
const nothing = null;// variable is nothing
const z = undefined;// variable is never was anything
// in practical usage NEVER assign the value undefined
// the 6th primitive is symbol which I HAVE NEVER USED
// the 7th primtive is bigInt

// null vs undefined
// null is a value that must be EXPLICITLY assigned in the code
// undefined is the default value of everything in JS
let x;
console.log(x)

// Very helpful when debugging
