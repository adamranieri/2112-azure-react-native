# JavaScript
- The most popular programming language in the world
    - The only language supported in web browsers.
- JavaScript was designed in 9 days by one guy, Brendan Eich
- Initial goal of JS was to make web pages *dynamic*
    - You click on something, something happens
- JS was intentionally designed to be flexible and not enforce coding practices
    - Java is the opposite. 
- JavaScript is to Java as Ham is to Hamster
    - They have very little in common.
    - JS was named as a maketing tactic to make it seem hip and advanced because Java had just come out.
- JavaScript has a lot of really *interesting* features

## Node JS

- It allows you to run JS **outside** of the web browser
- "Anything that can be written in JS *will* be written in JS" Atwood's Laws
